Dr. Burrows, initial post 1/11/16:

Post comments and questions about the class. 
Need help with homework or have a solution for others? Post it here.

Once you finish typing your post on your local copy, submit it as a pull request. By the way, most things git needed by us is covered in chapter 2: 
Git-Basics of the free textbook Pro Git at http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2.

Be sure and be specific enough when you ask a question that other people can understand what the problem is. 

An un-graded homework assignment that everyone should do is to read chapters 1 through 3 of the free textbook
Pro Git at http://www.git-scm.com/book/en/v2

It seems like we should edit and view this DiscussionBoard with gitpad or wordpad since notepad doesn't seem to display the new-lines properly all the time. 
Or any Linux native editor should do fine.

--January 13th, 2016. Evan Comeau:
I play baseball for UAM, set to graduate this semester. I plan to teach math in university some day. 
I'm a mathematics major with a teaching and learning minor.
 

--1/14/16, studentRoss: This note was posted from the computer lab on Comp-06.
first I created and logged into the studentRoss account on github.com
then I forked https://github.com/elrossco2/LearnPython.git to get a copy at https://github.com/studentRoss/LearnPython.git
Then I launched the Git Shell and did:

> git clone https://github.com/studentRoss/LearnPython.git
> cd LearnPython
> git remote add elrossco https://github.com/elrossco2/LearnPython.git
> git remote -v
> git pull elrossco master

This pulled down and merged all the stuff I didn't have yet.

--1/17/16, studentRoss: Next time in class we'll talk about git branch and git merge. 
This should help us understand working with remotes using git fetch and git pull.
Although there won't be a test on the Ch1 to Ch3 reading in Pro Git. 
The test will be that you are able to 
submit your programming exercise homework as a
>git push origin master
followed by a pull request. Then get the latest class materials using git fetch followed by git merge, 
or more simply do
>git pull cs3003 master
where cs3003 is the tag you gave to the URL of the class repo.

I do not really do much other than procrastinate and play video games. I intend to create video games upon graduating college.
